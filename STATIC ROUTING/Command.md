## WHAT IS STATIC ROUTING

## Static routing is a routing method where routes are manually configured by a network administrator on a router.
## The router does not learn routes automatically; you explicitly tell it where to send traffic for a particular network.

## Tools Used

-<b>Cisco IOS CLI<b/>

-<b>Network Devices<b/>

-<b>routers (Cisco routers)<b/>

-<b>Switches<b/>

-<b>PCs / End devices<b/>

-<b>Cables (Serial, Copper straight-through)<b/>


## Static routing is used because it:

-<b>Gives full control over routing paths

-<b>Consumes no bandwidth (no routing updates sent)

-<b>Is more secure (no route advertisements)

-<b>Is predictable and stable

-<b>Works well for small or simple networks

-<b>Common real-world use cases

-<b>Small office networks

-<b>Stub networks (networks with only one exit path)

-<b>Backup routes
